#Task 1:Built a temperature converter app using Python's Tkinter library. It converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with user-friendly input and clear output
Python program using Tkinter to build a temperature converter GUI application. Here's a summary of what your code accomplished:

Key Functionalities:

Temperature Conversion: The program can convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin based on user input.
User Input: It allows users to enter a temperature value and select the unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) for the original temperature.
Unit Selection: A dropdown menu provides options for selecting the unit of the temperature being entered.
Error Handling: The code includes error handling to catch invalid user input (non-numeric values) and displays an appropriate message box.
Clear Output: The converted temperature values in all three units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin) are displayed in a formatted label.
Technical Aspects:

Tkinter Library: You leveraged Tkinter, a Python library, to create the graphical user interface (GUI) elements like labels, entry fields, dropdown menus, and buttons.
Custom Styles: You implemented custom styles using ttk.Style to enhance the visual appearance of the application (fonts, colors, button styles).
Grid Layout: The Tkinter grid layout manager was used to arrange the GUI elements in a user-friendly manner.
